RP Implementation #4

Implemented the research paper titled "Path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles in complex environment based on an improved continuous ant colony optimisation."

Implemented this again. Works much better than the first iteration and the suggested improvements to ACO by the paper are very effective and improve the efficiency a lot compared to regular ACOr. Didn't have time to implement height and collision cost too well mainly distance.

Here are some pictures
